## Keeping things DRY
One of the design tenets of MVC is DRY ("Don't Repeat Yourself"). ASP.NET Core MVC encourages you to specify functionality or behavior only once, and then have it be reflected everywhere in an app. This reduces the amount of code you need to write and makes the code you do write less error prone, easier to test, and easier to maintain.
